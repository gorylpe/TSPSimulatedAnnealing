# Efficiency

Output differs from optimum for about
* **1%** for data size equals about **100 cities**
* **6%** for data size equals about **1000 cities**
* **12%** for data size equals about **10000 cities**.

Times for appropriate tests are widely dispersed
* **1500 - 5000 ms** for data size equals about **100 cities**
* **4500 - 53000 ms** for data size equals about **1000 cities**
* **125000 - 235000 ms** for data size equals about **10000 cities**

# Implementation details

Temperatures were chosen empirically by reading appropriate values from plots shown below.
The point was to limit iterations of algorithm to only these values which have real impact for finding
the best solution at the best time. Iterating at random solutions when temperature
is too high is as unnecessary as computationally expensive searching for next better solution
when temperature is enough low to make this searching unprofitable.

## Acceptance probability

Probability with which we accept worse solution than we got is calculated using this equation:
```C
diff = newCycleLength - currentCycleLength

probability = exp(- diff / temperature)
```
It means that for listed differences, corresponding probabilities will be:
* diff = **0.01** \* temperature, probability ~ **99%**
* diff = **0.05** \* temperature, probability ~ **95%**
* diff = **0.1** \* temperature, probability ~ **90%**
* diff = **0.3** \* temperature, probability ~ **74%**
* diff = **0.5** \* temperature, probability ~ **61%**
* diff = **0.7** \* temperature, probability ~ **50%**
* diff = **1.0** \* temperature, probability ~ **37%**
* diff = **1.5** \* temperature, probability ~ **22%**
* diff = **2.0** \* temperature, probability ~ **14%**
* diff = **4.0** \* temperature, probability ~ **2%**

## Starting solution
Starting solution is chosen randomly. The most probably solution will be called "average cycle"
with length calculated using equation listed below. Starting temperature equals length
of average cycle, it means
```C
Tstart = averageCycleLength = numberOfCities * (sumOfAllEdgesLengths / numberOfEdges)
```
And with this temperature acceptance probability for 2 times worse solution will be 36%.

## Starting and ending temperatures

At the beginning lets analyze some plots and determine where it will be the best point to start,
and to end to not waste time.

### Plots description
Cooling rate = **0.99995** </br>
X axis - number of iterations </br>
Y axis - cycle length </br>

#### n = 100
<img src="readme_images/n100.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

As we can see here the best values are:
```
starting iteration = 0       (temperature = Tstart * 1 (coolingRate ^ 0))
ending iteration   = 200000  (temperature = Tstart * 0.000045389 (coolingRate ^ 200000))
```

#### n = 1000
<img src="readme_images/n1000.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

The best values are:
```
starting iteration = 50000   (temperature = Tstart * 0.0821 (coolingRate ^ 50000))
ending iteration   = 275000  (temperature = Tstart * 0.000001067 (coolingRate ^ 275000))
```

#### n = 10000
<img src="readme_images/n10000.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

And finally the best values here are:
```
starting iteration = 100000   (temperature = Tstart * 0.006737 (coolingRate ^ 100000))
ending iteration   = 350000  (temperature = Tstart * 0.0000000251 (coolingRate ^ 350000))
```

### Temperatures precalculations

#### Starting temperature
As we can see, the starting temperature are increasing by a constant factor whenever number of cities
increase 10 times. We can define this by simple equation and precalculated value
```C
factor = 0.0821
T = Tstart * pow(factor, log10(n) - 2.0)
```

#### Ending temperature
The same way we can precalculate values to calculate ending temperature pretty fast
```C
firstFactor = 0.000045389
factor = 0.0235
Tmin = Tstart * firstFactor * pow(factor, log10(n) - 2.0)
```

### Plots after program modification
After modifications to iterations fit to appropriate start and end values,
and draw values only between minimum and maximum of calculated cycle length we've got expected results

#### n = 100
<img src="readme_images/n100_99995.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

#### n = 1000
<img src="readme_images/n1000_99995.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

#### n = 10000
<img src="readme_images/n10000_99995.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

## Other cooling rates

Above plots were depiciting **0.99995** cooling rate. What about the others?
Interestingly, cycle length behaves same way at cooling rate **0.99999**, and plots are the same
for the same factors for starting and ending temperatures. It means that cooling rate which is 5th root of **0.99995** makes the same job but 5 iterations in place of single iteration of previous cooling rate which can give more precise solutions.

But the time the program runs is **5 times** longer, with solution improvement for only about **30%**.
Of course cooling rate can be changed to calculate more accurate solutions, but for college use was limited to **0.99995**.

### Plots for better cooling rate

#### n = 100

#### n = 1000
<img src="readme_images/n1000_99999.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

#### n = 10000

# Summary

I think I made pretty good analysis of simulated annealing metaheuristic.
Everything consists of my own research on this subject. In my opinion these plots and their interpretation are enough to construct an efficient program.
