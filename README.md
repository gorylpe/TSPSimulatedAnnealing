# Efficiency

Output differs from optimum for about **1%** for data size equals about **100 cities**,
**6%** for data size equals about **1000 cities**, and **12%** for data size **10000 cities**.

Times for appropriate tests are widely dispersed. For n = 100 times was between 1500-5000 ms
* n = 100,    t = 1500   - 5000   ms
* n = 1000,   t = 4500   - 53000  ms
* n = 10000,  t = 125000 - 235000 ms
